I wish SAGE was more conscious about the waste they produced and what message regarding the environment they're sending to young scientists. As ""representatives"" of what scientists look like, I feel that environmentalism should be stressed to a greater degree. (ex. entire script printed out, plastic packaging, etc. I believe Rebecca S. shared the same sentiment.) 
- during the anxiety (achieving presence) professional growth session, I was disappointed that anxiety disorders were not addressed. 18.1%, (or in context 1 in 5 girls in each professional group) suffer from anxiety disorders, where saying ""I am excited"" doesn't always help. The session was interesting, and I'm sure it helped many girls, but I wish that the mental health aspect was acknowledged, as it is a large part of many individuals' lives and stress. 
- During the first project group day, I was grouped with a leader that had trouble explaining how to make a flashlight. In the end, I helped three girls work through the project. I didn't mind it, but I had just assumed that the project guide would do the guiding. They had great intentions, but may have benefitted from a training session on how to lead/explain the project. 
- I wish we talked about more serious/potent/influential topics during the professional growth session. I think that the current professional growth sessions were good, but they seemed to be catered toward a younger age group. Many of the girls in my session seemed very capable, and I think many also already came to the conclusions presented in the growth groups. I would have loved to have conversations about the peer review process, what it's like to conduct research, the possible frequency of sexual assault (especially towards women) in academia, the workaholic culture of academia (does the ""ideal"" scientist exist?) and how it is being addressed, the entire concept of the ivory tower, etc. This is not to say that what was covered was bad, no! It is simply bringing up more current, maybe not so bright sides of science. What about connecting (work-wise)? Teaching students how to send follow-up emails and maintain/establish connections (which are unfortunately extremely influential in the working world)? Teach them what the system is, and how to work with it. (Maybe this is outside the goal of SAGE? Maybe SAGE IS catered toward a younger, more exploratory group of girls? Maybe splitting it into 2 groups, one for younger, and one for older girls, is the way to go? Maybe.) Just a few thoughts. 
- I personally feel like I did not significantly benefit from the professional growth sessions, BUT I know that many others did. I had already heard many of the messages that were spread, and had found that applying some of the advice in the past (yes, and...) had led to worse situations (overcommitment, impacted social life). 
- I think it's important to remind girls that every journey is different. The advice that applies to one individual from a shadow talk may not apply to everyone. I say this because some of the advice/stats provided have been scientifically disproven. Therefore, please stress that all advice should be taken with a grain of salt! 
- CANVAS was difficult to navigate at times, but it came with practice! 
- timing was good, actually! I enjoyed that it was during the morning, and I enjoyed how early it started (I wouldn't mind if it started earlier). Zoom-fatigue was real, though! I took a 2 hour nap every day afterward, haha :)

(Maybe this camp isn't catered toward my demographic? Which is why my experience was different to others?) 

I admire how you ask for feedback, and I know how valuable feedback can be. Although I wrote out a whole laundry list (!) of ""lowlights,"" this is not to say that the camp was good! I've heard great things from other SAGE girls, and how their outlooks/lives/perceptions of STEM have changed as a result of the camp. I admire how much thought and effort was put into preparing the camp, and the intent of the camp (to increase female participation in STEM) is very noble and justified. The existence of teams like yours (SAGE) are of utmost importance to an improvement to the gender balance in STEM fields. Thank you for all you do. It makes the world of difference. 

In general: these are all just suggestions! No need to take/address them all. My experience is likely different than everyone's. Please read everything with several grains of salt. Again, thank you. ","- Programs like these! Giving girls opportunities to say ""wow!! How does that work??"" is great. Tinkering opportunities, just like you guys offered, work wonders. 
- Mentorships/internships: personal connections with role models in the field can be monumental to increasing participation in the STEM fields. Advice and support along the way. 
- seeing female role models in the field. 

During #shutdownstem and #shutdownacademia, this report from American Institute of Physics TEAM-UP group made its rounds: (https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/aipcorp/files/teamup-full-report.pdf) it analyzes and offers specific suggestions for increasing participation of certain groups. It's not directly for women, but I think many of the suggestions are applicable!! I would definitely recommend taking a read/skimming. ","It meant a week of experimenting, long naps, tinkering, being open to new ideas, accepting sparks of curiosity and looking forward to fanning them into a flame.

My favorite part was the professional growth sessions. I think it was very beneficial for us to be placed into small groups, as we could connect with each other more easily and on a more personal level. Of course, with a virtual camp, there are always technical difficulties: I, for one, sometimes had internet, audio, and Canvas issues. Furthermore, the time/schedule didn't seem too well planned out since we would often go overtime for some sessions, leaving little to no time for a break. The project session could definitely be longer; I know a lot of people had trouble finishing their projects just during the allotted time, but the office hours were a really good idea that helped with that! (I also see that the ""How satisfied are you with various aspects"" question has been fixed, but some parts of the question do not apply, as the camp was virtual this year)","I am a kinesthetic learner, so I think hand-on projects are the way to go! Other girls may learn differently and have different needs though.","This SAGE-S camp was a great experience for me, and I woke up excited for the camp every day this week.
