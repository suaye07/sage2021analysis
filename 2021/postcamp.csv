  -  Noel Bakhitan (career talk)(it's awesome how she got to work with congress people) 
- Jie Qi, (chibitronics)(I had a lot of fun working on chibitronics and it was interesting/different hearing how she combined multiple disciplines)
Some speakers were particularly interesting to me specifically because of the fields they work in - 
- Revathi Jambunathan (LLNL/LBNL slam event)(I was really interested/engaged in when she talked about pulsars)
- Kianna Von Maydell (job shadow) (working with crispr-cas9 seems really cool specifically since it's so new)",Staying in touch with some scientists and engineers will allow me to have people to ask questions to (about specific phenomena and about working in their field).

One thing I learned was that a planetary nebula is actually full of old stars, not planets.","I think that sometimes the project times were too short because there was a lot to do and a lot of variation in what you could do (e.g. looking at slides during microscopy). It would be helpful for those times to be a bit longer. Also I feel like the steps were really well structured to help us complete chibitronics and the wind/solar activity, though I prefer that it would have been more step my step for microscopy. It felt a bit jumbled but that may have been such there was so much stuff to look at/do.
Also during job shadows I felt it was especially fun when we saw live tours or prerecorded tours. I know not all the participants could do this because of their schedules/jobs, but I just wanted to point this out. 

Sometimes I got a bit confused during community events because sometimes they would refer to something that SLAC was specifically doing (e.g. a project) that related to what they were observing/talking about, and not elaborate.   

Overall I had a lot of fun listening to speakers and doing projects and I have a lot of new knowledge, which I can do further research on the new things I've learned.

I also think hearing from women in the stem field is really important to show young women like myself, the people out there doing cool stuff in stem.","It was so much fun participating in the sage-camp and it gave me something to look forward to during the summer. I enjoyed listening to so many scientists and engineers and learning about their fields. After each session I was always excited to tell my parents what I did in camp that day (projects), and all the new concepts I've learned.

This is unique, as at job fairs or career fairs, you don't get too see the specifics, or something that might peak your interest. Working through the projects from people who have worked on accelerators, for example, enables you to get a hands on experience. From this, I have sorted in my head if I want to pursue more theoretical science fields, or applicable engineering fields. ","These camps, which provide hands on experience and job shadowing of persons in STEM is the best way to engage more young women. It gives them hands on experience that is not offered anywhere else in many of our communities. ","I was flattered and very excited to attend SAGE Camp. The fact that someone showed interest in engaging me in their profession was very inspiring to experience. I got hands on, one on one experience with professionals in various stages of their career, and how they got there. The fact that attendees were in my role, and my stage of career, was insightful, helpful, and exciting. I cannot wait to attend the SAGE Live events, and staying in contact with professionals. I can ask insider questions that are not generic, vague, and watered down. Seeing professionals that looked like me and had similar interests was extraordinary, and applicable for not just in a STEM field, but in my professional and personal life. Thank you!"

The two major suggestions I have are making the community events more engaging or shortening the time, and also having a 45-minutes break during lunch time at 12pm or 12:30 pm, instead of shorter 30-minutes breaks at 11:15am and 1:30pm. There also wasn't much talking during the project breakout rooms, and it wasn't as fun as some of the other events. The projects themselves were exciting, though! Overall, I had an amazing experience!","I think that programs like SAGE, which help you make personal connections with amazing scientists (like Ms. Diana and Mr. Steve!) and amazing students, are the best way to encourage young women in STEM.","To me, participating in SAGE means getting to know amazing people that I will definitely keep in touch with! It means sharing my experiences with others and learning about theirs in professional growth sessions, discovering more about myself in the process. It means hearing from passionate scientists that are fascinated by their work.
