To start off, I am a part of a jazz band, jazz ensemble, marching band/concert band at my school and those usually require time outside of school as we have night practices, sectionals, and weekend practices. This was of course before the pandemic, but even at home we have gotten the opportunity to better perfect our own individual musicianship. Music has always been a big part of my life, since I was small my dad knew how to play guitar, bass and violin, and on many occasions he would participate in the choir at church along with my mom. My entire family is full of musicians so at parties there is always music playing. I am not a singer myself, but I do enjoy playing instruments as I play the trumpet, and my dad has been teaching me and my siblings guitar. Apart from music, I got a job not too long ago and it is going great so far. I work as a server at a retirement home, I have learned so many new things and I actually enjoy working alongside the team I have. I have built up my social skills through this job as I get to talk to people and get conversation going while they order and or wait for their food. For volunteer work I actually joined a club called key club, and it has been a great experience so far even if it was online. I became a part of their service committee, which is basically just a group of people who plan out the events to earn community service. Some of these services I have contributed with are making story books for children, as well as alphabet books, making thank you cards for the essential workers, and recently since it is the month to empower women I suggested we make cards for impactful women in our life. That could be someone's aunt who is a nurse, firefighter, just anything. Community service has been limited due to the pandemic, but even virtually key clubs strive to help out and empower the voices of many. Something I have really found a deep passion for during all of this has been exercising, I think it really helps clear my mind and stimulates it, sometimes doing it will motivate me to do other stuff like schoolwork. Last but not least, I have always enjoyed reading, that is actually one of the main sources that helped me learn english when I first came to the United States. It was super hard, but In elementary school I began to read so many books and it really helped me so much, and I will forever be grateful for books as they help send me into a new world within every page.

The field of graphic design has always been interesting to me and my passion for digital art is what motivated me to join organizations such as The Design Pact. The Design Pact is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to helping small businesses and NPOs transition and thrive on online platforms by providing free design and marketing services. I have also been dancing for the past 12 years and am the current captain of Dougherty Dhadkan, which is Dougherty Valley High School’s fusion Bollywood dance team. In addition, I have been learning Carnatic (Indian) violin for 8 years and play the viola in a couple music clubs. Apart from the arts, I have dedicated much of my time to social service and volunteering through clubs such as California Scholarship Federation and Red Cross. I have also been able to gain 3 years of experience as a founding member of Radha Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit public benefit organization. Radha Foundation’s goal is to improve and enrich the lives of the disadvantaged members of society who do not have reliable access to food, basic supplies, and healthcare. We do this through hosting donation drives and fundraising events, as well as packaging food to be donated to local homeless shelters. I am also the President of the Radha Foundation Club at Dougherty Valley High School which focuses on connecting students from California with orphan kids in India through an online pen pal program. I have previous experience volunteering as a tutor for the past 3 years. I have tutored elementary schoolers (3rd grade to 5th grade) for 2 years. For the past one year I have been tutoring 8th graders at the Camp Parks Army Base in subjects including math, science, and english (with a focus on math). Through being a tutor, I was able to get better at working with others to achieve a common goal. I worked as an intern for the Nancy Ellen Crooks Foundation where I created infographics and posts for the 'Nancy’s Gardens' initiative which helps to supplement school feeding programs in Kenya. In addition to establishing school and community kitchen gardens to teach children how to grow their own food organically. I continue to pursue my interest in STEM outside of school as the current Vice President of Biology For Better Northern California, which is a student-led organization aiming to help unprivileged children to learn more about STEM through making video modules, webinars, worksheets and workshops to help those in need. In addition, I am a Director of Biology for Girl STEMpowerment, which is an organization that aims to help young girls develop interests in the STEM field and mentor them in competitive events such as Biology, Math, and Computer Science.

Not only is it a great way for me to express my emotions, but I learned how to concretely and concisely say what I want to. One of my most recent poems is titled “USS Covid,” and I talk about my isolation from others due to covid 19. Another one of my poems that is published at Cathartic Literary Magazine, “Owning Up,” is a confessional poem where I talk about self-doubt and my embarrassment while speaking to others. Through writing this poem, I discovered my true feelings, which was therapeutic in a way. I hope my poems can also inspire other people to start writing or just help them in general if they can relate to it. Due to COVID, I haven’t able to swim, until recently since my high school opened up some of their sports programs so I joined the swim team. I have been swimming competitively since I was 10 and though it is incredibly tiring, I find it fun and rewarding, especially when I beat my best time. Before COVID started, I volunteered at a program to be a young leader and help teach kids every Friday. We also had game time where other leaders and myself would lead various activities for the younger children. Another activity I do is playing the piano. I’ve been playing since kindergarten, and at first it was tiring and painful to practice because all I wanted to do was to play outside, but now I appreciate the skill that I have learned to create beautiful music for myself and other people’s enjoyment.

I’ve been drawing and playing the piano for as long as I can remember; nothing engages and relaxes me more than being able to take creative liberty with a pencil in my hand or my fingers on the keyboard. Recently, I decided to turn my passions into helping others and started volunteering in creating cards for children with cancer. It’s rewarding to be able to give back to the community while doing something I love. I’m currently also testing for CM Level 10 in piano. It took me a while to really enjoy the music, and I’ve become a more appreciative person. The sound of the piano is  beautiful to me, and there isn’t a day I don’t thank my past self for continuing with this journey. I found out that I enjoyed writing around elementary school, and combined with my passion for storytelling, characters wove themselves into intricate storylines conjured from my then ten-year-old brain. I had a special love for dystopian stories, and the complexities of the worldbuilding and character mentalities prompted me to write my own. Staying active is another important part of my lifestyle, and past athletics include dance and swimming. Currently, I’ve played badminton for the past 4 years, and ended up joining the school team. Being on my feet has definitely moved me towards a healthier, calmer life. In the quiet, still hours away from the bustling activity in school, I’m able to spend my quality time enjoying the activities that I love the most in the comfortable time away from the world.
