I did not feel safe in the class. Therefore, I expressed this situation to my teacher in a feedback form she shared with the class. I met with my teacher after school and proceeded to have a thoughtful and open conversation with her about the situation, and she explained that the male students were struggling at home and at school, and how this also did not excuse their behavior. She agreed to scatter their seats, and now I finally feel safe in that class.","For as long as I can remember, I have been petrified of public speaking.

It was never, particularly my strong suit.
 Ever since roughly the beginning of my first year at high school, I‚Äôve made it my mission to overcome my monumental social anxiety. Although I have improved immensely in the personal interactions department, an insubstantial amount of progress has been made in seamlessly speaking in front of a large crowd. It was not looking great; my voice was silent.
 Until one day, January 9 of this year, my school posted on the Daily Bulletin: the Speak and Lead with Pride program, a hands-on course designed to assist Asian Pacific American students in developing public speaking and leadership skills. It was like a sign from the heavens. I had a chance to discover my voice.
 I submitted my application on the 14th of January, which consisted of a glowing letter of recommendation written by my wise IB English teacher, my transcript, and a half-page-long response to a written prompt, then waited eagerly for my results.
 To my surprise, I was accepted into the program and have attended four sessions thus far!

We had a debate over how the teacher should have punished the students for a stolen jacket. In the story, student A did not speak English and was given a jacket from the lost and found by the vice principle. Student B saw student A‚Äôs jacket that he lost and fought with student A. The teacher punished both the students. In our summer camp, everyone else argued that only student B should have gotten punished. From my experiences, I learned that blaming one person for a fight was simple but not efficient. From this story alone, punishing only student B, who acted only because he saw his jacket, was unfair since he didn‚Äôt know about student A‚Äôs situation. Punishing only student A was unfair since the vice principle gave him the jacket. This logical thought process of mine did not think only student B should have been punished, so I went against the vote. I explained my thought process of how both were innocent and that added more interesting conversation to our discussion. My explanation did convince some people to blame both the students and that discussion evolved into more of a argument about blame and justice.","I decided one day that I wanted to help out my mom with the restaurant. She seemed so tired and burned out by the way she collapsed into bed every night. As an introvert, talking to people I don‚Äôt know or communicating my thoughts directly are very hard to do. As a host in a restaurant, I had to talk and lead people to their table, which made me uncomfortable. Talking to people older than me as well as people I didn‚Äôt know made my body awkward and my mind shaky. However, the large amount of customers made me go into a rhythm, similar to when I dance. I became more smooth with my movements as well as became more confident that I was doing the right thing. I also connected with the employees, asking them questions and became more familiar with them. From this experience, I learned about having self-confidence as an individual out of their comfort zone.

I saw myself flourish, become the number three varsity tennis player for my team. Tennis gave me strength and control, showed me that there will be something stable when change occurs. I also spend a lot of time at my first school in America. I come after school and help with the children there. Helping these children gives me a sense of peace. One would never know what a child experiences at home or in their mind. As a child moving across the world, nobody seemed to care about what I felt and how much it hurt to leave my world behind. As I spend my after-school hours at the school, I leave hoping that the children I helped were able to be distracted from the cruel world for even a minute.

We left our home, family, friends, our lives behind. I took plenty of English classes while I lived in Russia, yet this would not be equivalent to me being fluent. My lack of communication gave me a disadvantage and a barrier when it came to trying to ask for help from my teachers and classmates. My broken English leaving my lips was something I found out people did not like. As a child growing up in a land so unknown, it took me over two years to lose some of my languages and gain the language of a country that did not want me.

My 8th grade American history teacher once engaged the class in an open discussion regarding whether the Union or the Confederacy was morally correct on the issue of slavery. At first, I didn't offer an opinion out of sheer embarrasment and fear. My peers' discussion evolved into an intense discussion on if slavery was cruel or not. I could feel eyes on me and panic swelling up. My initial reaction was to sit back and avoid confrontation, but eventually I realized that this conversation needed to be stopped. I interjected with a personal story of my grandparents' struggles as black Americans before desegregation laws. One student stepped back on their views and the other ceased responding.

I have a tendency to freeze up and anticipate that things are happening quicker than they actually are. My coach gave me twelve things to remember when I‚Äôm stressed on-court. Every piece of information she tells me, I remember and all of them run through my head during each and every shot that comes off my racket. This may seem like a cause of stress for some, but recalling information calms me down and keeps my form in check. Additionally, with almost every mistake I make, I know what I‚Äôve done and how to fix it. Another example lies in my future goals.

I joined a group of four students where we worked on questions ranging from simple arithmetic to more complex equations. We decided to work on the questions individually before comparing our answers. I was satisfied with my work and was eager to share my solutions. However, on one particular problem, my answer deviated from the rest of the group's answers. As you can imagine, my group members quickly dismissed my answer, causing me to momentarily doubt my calculations. Despite the group pushing to move on to the next problem, I held firm. I suggested that we all go through the steps of how to solve it. Being outnumbered, I felt a little intimidated, but I was confident in my work. We methodically went through the problem, each person explaining their points of view. When my turn came, I had a better understanding of each group member's approach in trying to solve the question. This helped me to show how I solved the problem. I was able to explain my answer in a way that was respectful of our disagreements. Finally, I was able to show them that my answer was correct in a constructive manner. This taught me some important lessons: the importance of trusting my abilities, speaking up and recognizing that it is possible to discuss differences collaboratively, civilly, and productively.","Two skills that I have worked towards in the last few years are learning to play violin and speak Spanish. In our elementary school music program, I was introduced to the violin. This was the first time I picked up a musical instrument, and I immediately liked it. I was determined to get better, so I started private lessons and participated in my school orchestra. As it turns out, I‚Äôm not the best violin player, but it has taught me many important skills that I will continue to use in my life: the importance of consistent practice and concentration. When a problem is difficult, I know that I need to keep working at it and trying new approaches in order to achieve a goal. It is when your mind is focused and clear of distractions that creative solutions come. When I am faced with a difficult biology lab question, for example, I know that the best solution comes with trial and error, patience, focus and practice, just like learning new music. Learning a new language has sharpened my memory and communication skills. My Spanish studies have helped my approach to learning in other areas. Specifically, learning Spanish grammar has improved my English grammar and writing as well. I have strengthened my vocabulary through the review of cognates. Foreign language learning has helped me realize that there are many ways to say the same thing, but the best communicators are able to choose just the right word to express themselves effectively.","[""Learning about what STEM is"", ""Finding subjects that are exciting to study in college that I was not aware of before"", ""Meeting scientists and engineers"", ""Establishing relationships or a network that will help me in the future"", ""Learning that other fields (such as communication, history, or art) impact work in STEM""]",Somewhat Disagree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Somewhat Agree,I have never met anyone who works at a National Laboratory,I have met an engineer once or twice,I often interact with someone who is a scientist,Daily,Weekly,Weekly,Daily,Public Health,I am unfamiliar with the DOE National Laboratories,I am not familiar with accelerators

A big problem that stemmed from this was adults belittling the voices of the youth. Adults from the community were petitioning for students to not be allowed in the meetings; for a problem that most directly affected us. I am part of an organization called La Cosecha. A youth-led group dedicated to serving the city of Salinas by addressing problems and concerns. When this situation arose, we immediately took action.

With my experiences from being a preschool student, remembering the techniques that were used with me, and from help from my preschool teacher parent, I was able to come up with ideas for getting the students to listen better. Some of these ideas were to have them help come up with rules to follow and to give two minute warnings before moving stations. The managers, with their experiences teaching children, recommended talking to the parents and the children before the class starts.

I could then use the knowledge that I learned to help solve more complicated problems or help my classmates understand the topic. Another example is when I could not preform a flag toss for color guard. Because I could not do this skill, I went outside and practiced over and over, each time seeing what did not work and trying again until I could do better. I could then use the skill I learned in color guard to preform with and use in the color guard show. I could also use the methods of seeing what went wrong to help with other guard skills and skills in life.

We were assigned a feminist lens of the vignette ""Marin,"" a girl who objectifies herself to gain freedom from her oppressed lifestyle. My other teammates viewed Marin as a girl trapped in traditional gender roles, fighting to escape her fate which is a positive outlook for feminism. However, I interpreted it differently as she willingly allows herself to get objectified, and her dependency on men to save her traps Marin inside oppression. She did not fight for her fate but left them in the hands of the patriarchy. I presented my interpretation to my teammates with textual evidence, and we added it to our analysis. I realized with evidence can one be reliable and trustworthy. With no evidence, my teammates would not have believed me.

I have often found myself at odds with my parents‚Äô way of thinking. This difference has sometimes led to unusual solutions to household problems. Two years ago our living room tower fan started malfunctioning. Of its hundreds of tiny blades arranged on a cylindrical blower, a few had broken off, and thrown it off balance. My parents and uncle tried various approaches such as superglue, heat, and hot glue to reattach the broken pieces, but none of their ideas worked. I suggested that instead of reattaching, we remove some more blades in an even pattern, to bring back the balance. This simple and elegant solution worked great with little loss in performance.
 
 As a dancer and assistant choreographer, I found myself in a difficult situation in 2019. We were preparing for a bay-area wide Bollywood dance competition. On our team of eight, only two (including me) dancers could perform a relatively hard step involving two back bends and walkovers. The team knew if we all did this step, we would have a better shot at winning our competition, but forcing everyone to learn and perform this part of the dance was challenging and got a bit frustrating. Most of the team and the choreographer were in favor of skipping this step. My creative idea was to freeze the other dancers for a brief 10 seconds and spotlight the two dancers. The solution worked fine and we won second place.","I despise cancer. My grandma is a cancer survivor. She survived the deadly disease a few years before I was born.

Looking back at that moment, it wasn‚Äôt a huge deal, but my embarrassment was understandable. From that experience, I learned not to rush into things and that everybody starts as a beginner. I started practicing on the street and in parking garages which helped me develop a muscle for control. When I returned to the skatepark, I felt better about my ability to go down an easy ramp. The more I made attempts, failed, and got back up again, the more agility I gained. Eventually, I learned how to drop into the second deepest bowl in the park.

My friends and I mostly agreed on the same candidates, since we shared the same points of views most of the time.

Some physical extracurriculars I engage in are playing badminton and dancing ballet. I joined my school's badminton team starting out in junior varsity, and now making the varsity team. This is my first year of being in a school sport, and it has definitely pushed me outside of my comfort zone. I used to just play during my free time with my dad, but I loved it so much that it has become something more than just a casual hobby. I also dance ballet twice a week and have been for more than a decade. Although I dance non-competitively, I still like to challenge myself beyond my physical capacities.
 Mentally enriching hobbies I have are writing on my blog and drawing. Ever since I was in elementary school, I have found a particular interest in writing. I better express myself through words. However, it was only until a year ago that I wrote more frequently for my own growth than for school purposes. After a week of creating and designing my website, I began to publish my pieces. Recently, I have also written more personal articles in Chinese, my second language. I used to avoid writing Chinese because I was not good at it and because I was forced to, but now I genuinely love challenging myself to express my thoughts within a different language. 
 I am also an artist, and I enjoy this process very much as I am improving my observational skills.",NO,NO,"4-Year College Diploma (BA,BS)","In my English and history classes as well as in my personal relationships, we have group discussions. In this, we take a topic and discuss our views on the subject, even when there are contradicting ideas. Even though many come into the discussion believing they are correct, we often come out with some new insight. Although we may not agree with others' ideas, we usually understand where one person is coming from. For example, in a recent discussion in my English class, we discussed if Bergdahl (a soldier) should be tried for desertion. Although I didn't have a strong stance, I gave out evidence as a counterclaim to someone else's point. Despite disagreeing, it was clear that we simply had different ideas on justice and the severity of desertion. Even though we wanted to have a compelling case, we understood that our experiences which shaped the way we view things were just different. 
 Sometimes conflict is also a good thing. Without the discussion of differing ideas, science and technology cannot advance. If there is only one right way to do things or see things, our progress would be stagnant. I believe that challenging situations are not bad, even if people don't necessarily agree, as long as everyone keeps an open mind.
 In any discussion, while there may be tension if we don't understand the others' side, when we recognize that our different experiences shape our ideas, we can agree to disagree on some areas and find common ground on others.","I have demonstrated a drive to learn new thing through the creation of my blog. Because it was my first time making a website, I didn't know where to start. In addition, I did not have any guidance as I didn't know anyone who had made a website before. Although there were many challenges, I still persisted because I knew that the blog was a meaningful project to me. After a week, I had created and designed the website. In addition to creating the physical website, I also demonstrated a drive to learn by writing my articles. At first, I did not consistently write but eventually, I wrote more and better. I also challenged myself to learn how to write Chinese personal articles. As I have written a few, I am already noticing an improvement in my writing. I can apply these skills to solve problems because I know I am determined to persistent in challenges that I care about. For example, I used my persistence, drive to learn, and curiosity in taking a college psychology course at my local community college.

As a Filipino living in a predominately Hispanic community, I felt constantly targeted because of the cultural differences. When bringing foreign foods to school, I would be made fun of and asked multiple, obviously racist questions. Being part of a minority group in a town full of minorities really gave me the connection with the Latinx students around me because we all go through a lot of the same identity struggles, but I often felt under and misrepresented. I wanted to find an escape for myself while also finding others that felt the same as me. When I began high school, I found that connection within the Filipino club at school. I soon became greatly involved in the club and after about six months, I took up the leadership position of publicist. Growing the knowledge of our culture, language, and educating those around me through social media posts and further outreach gave the healing feeling that many of my club members and I really needed to address our past challenges of racism and belonging.

We also take student athletes into account and how we can improve the lighting at night so they could have a brighter place to wait for their parents after practice.

As I saw the frustration of my teammates on the sidelines, I shared my ideas with them and Mr. C. Though I gave an outside approach, others agreed and we changed the way our practices run. As a result, players of all skill sets began to get equal playing time during practice, Mr. C works one on one occasionally to give different people specialized help, we do different drills, and we all have a better time.","Due to COVID 19 and mental health issues, I dropped Trigonometry Sophomore year. When signing up for my junior year classes, the counselor told me I didn‚Äôt qualify for calculus. I really love math and desperately wanted to take the class, so I asked if I could take precalculus over the summer. I remember him telling me, ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt recommend it. But I can‚Äôt stop you.‚Äù The process to find and get into a summer course at the very last minute was difficult. Because I didn‚Äôt meet the prerequisites, I had to take a test to get into the class. I studied as hard as I could, and then failed the test. This was a tremendous let-down, but I continued to study and try again because I wouldn‚Äôt stop working to get into the calculus class. While I was on vacation with my family, I continued to study and took the test again. And failed again. Finally, after failing twice, spending hours studying on my summer break, I passed the test and qualified to enter the class. This struggle to get into the math class I truly wanted, and to have to work around obstacles for it, gave me the ability to be persistent, even when I fail, which I struggled with in the past. When I am faced with a problem and my initial solution fails, I know I can always try a different way and keep trying until I find an alternative solution.","[""Meeting scientists and engineers"", ""Meeting peers with similar interests"", ""Finding role models and mentors for myself"", ""Learning what National Laboratories do"", ""Establishing relationships or a network that will help me in the future"", ""Learning about different careers in STEM"", ""Gaining hands on experience with projects""]",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Disagree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Disagree,I do not know,I have met someone who works at a National Laboratory once or twice,I often interact with someone who is an engineer,I have met a scientist once or twice,Weekly,Monthly,Weekly,Daily,environmental engineering or maybe physics,I am familiar with some of the DOE National Laboratories,I am somewhat familiar with accelerators

At school, I am an Academic Peer Tutor for underclassmen. Outside, I work 4+ hours a week as an Assistant Tutor at Kumon Institute of Education. I facilitate a learning environment for children from 3 to 18 and patiently assist them in learning fundamental to more advanced skills in math and English. One of my other hobbies is sketching and developing physical and digital designs. I volunteer as a Marketing Director with a non-profit organization‚ÄîWeStandWithYou‚Äîto create flyers and posters. I help the team put together goody bags and bake goods for two local hospitals and three local fire stations every month. Another way I utilize this art interest is by assembling cards every other month for senior citizens in Canada (sendingsunshineca) and children‚Äôs hospitals in the United States (lettersfordestiny). At school, I partake in Speech and Debate. My partner and I compete in Public Forum multiple times throughout the year. Last season, we competed against many teams at the junior varsity level at the Columbia University Invitational. As a girl-only team, we ended up reaching the quarterfinals. Debate events allow me to research certain social, political, and economic facets of global events and speak passionately about them. As for pure relaxation, my favorite activity has got to be either reading or hiking with my dog. I have a highly-active dog so we often go walking on different trails on warmer days and on rainy ones, I curl up with books.",NO,YES,"4-Year College Diploma (BA,BS)","One of my team members, in our nonprofit organization, was harshly critiquing a fellow group member‚Äôs work. Despite our team wanting to present our best work and often learning from each other and constructive criticism, this situation was escalating and putting our collaboration and other various projects at risk. I decided to interfere neutrally and offer that we all draft some new designs before selecting one. I also suggested we compile a list of requirements for the specific event to ensure all the desired elements were incorporated. In the end, our team was able to finish the task, before time, by having a refreshed start. We even managed to input new concepts we were unsure of how to employ before working together.","When I was in elementary and middle school, I adored playing the piano. However, in high school, I was disappointed to discover that piano was not offered as an elective. Determined to join my friends in the school orchestra, I started attending violin lessons. Despite not having a violin background, I was able to build upon my piano techniques to learn violin quickly. My music sight-reading and improvisation skills helped me to further my learning as a systematic thinker. This method allows me to connect things in my head, and figure out an ideal scenario through evaluation and analysis. For example, on a test, I solve problems by conquering what I know first and then drawing upon those techniques to make deductions to solve the following ones. Another way I use this method is in my Spanish class. I attempt to connect Spanish phrases, and words, back to English in order to identify keywords.","[""Meeting scientists and engineers"", ""Meeting peers with similar interests"", ""Finding role models and mentors for myself"", ""Learning that other fields (such as communication, history, or art) impact work in STEM"", ""Finding subjects that are exciting to study in college that I was not aware of before""]",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Somewhat Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Agree,I have never met anyone who works at a National Laboratory,I often interact with someone who is an engineer,I have met a scientist once or twice,Daily,Monthly,Weekly,Daily,Neuroscience,I am familiar with some of the DOE National Laboratories,I am somewhat familiar with accelerators

The essay grade would heavily impact our grade, and so far the rest of my group worked hard and collaboratively accordingly. In the days leading up to the due date, I reached out to that teammate and asked about why they weren't able to pull together their section of essay. They explained that they were going through a hardship at home and couldn't put as much energy as usual into their school work. Family conflicts are extremely exhausting, so I can feel for what they went through.
 
 The next day, I arranged a meeting with the remaining members of my team where I tasked each of them with a portion of the unfinished essay. With my teammates meaningful contributions, we managed to write a high quality essay by the end of our work session.

Through my Destination Imagination journey, I learned valuable lessons about creatively making use of materials I have on hand and keeping conversation lively.

Sometimes, he doesn't follow the instructions because he doesn't understand what he's doing is wrong. For instance, for his latest Animal Research Project, he cited Google as a resource. When I tried to explain that he didn't actually cite a resource, he argued that he used Google to find his answers, so it was his resource. So, I walked him through the significance of citing sources, and how doing so allowed others to do their own research and demonstrated his accountability- but how his work could only achieve these things if he cited directly to the specific websites and articles that he used. With this new perspective, he understood how to fix his mistakes to get a better grade.","Whenever I apply for extracurriculars like the SAGE camp, I am excited to broaden my skill set and learn new things.
